# SpeakUp


## Introduction

The purpose of the SpeakUp application is to information users about the SpeakUp English camps.  It also provides an application form through which users may apply for the camp.


## Requirements

SpeakUp was built for use with MySQL.  Upon installing the application, a configuration file must be created.

See the example file:
> 'includes/config.example.php'

To use this file, copy it to:
> 'includes/config.php'

Once this is done, you may use the included schema dump file 'includes/db.sql' to build the database.  Do not leave this file where it is while in production.
