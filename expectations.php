<h2>Expectations to Consider</h2>
<p>Before you decide to spend a week at SpeakUp!, please take some time to consider the expectations we have for those who choose to come to the camp.  SpeakUp! is not for everyone, though everyone is invited.  If you choose to come to SpeakUp!, you are choosing to be involved in several aspects of the SpeakUp! experience.</p>
<p>Please consider the following expectations we have for camp attendees as you determine if you want to be a part of SpeakUp!.</p>

<h2>Involvement in all camp activities</h2>
<p>One non-negotiable of coming to SpeakUp! is involvement in all camp activities.</p>
<p>We are holding our camp in a resort location.  The cost of the camp, including food and lodging, is very attractive for the location.  However, SpeakUp! is not simply an inexpensive vacation at a nice location.  During the week we will have a number of activities including, but not limited to, group class time, verbal games and interactions, individualized tutor times, small group discussions, large group dances and parties, etc...  If you apply and are accepted to SpeakUp! you will be required to attend all camp activities.</p>
<p>If you are not intending to involve yourself in all camp activities, SpeakUp! is not for you.  If you come only to take advantage of our inexpensive food and lodging, and do not participate in camp activities, you will be asked to leave.  The success of SpeakUp! is dependant on the involvement of those who come.</p>
<p>The schedule allows for significant free time.  There is ample time free during the day and evenings to "hang out" at the beach or pursue your own interests.  One whole day is set aside for an excursion to a beautiful beach and resort area.  We will attempt to schedule camp activities around local opportunities that you may want to be involved in.  It is our desire that SpeakUp! is a relaxing and enjoyable camp for you.  We will provide a fantastic relational camp experience at a great location for an attractive price.  We simply ask that, if you come, you participate.</p>

<h2>Acceptance limited to university students</h2>
<p>SpeakUp! is for university students only.</p>
<p>We provide a unique and attractive conversational English experience.  Many people may desire to benefit from this opportunity but the space we have to offer is limited.  SpeakUp! tutors are all American university students.  We strive to provide you individual attention by having one American university student tutor for no more than 4 SpeakUp! participants.  Because of the unique focus of SpeakUp! we will only accept applications from people who are current university students.  Only those who are current (or will be by the fall of <?php echo $settings['current_year']; ?>) university students in Belgrade, Novi Sad or Nis, will be accepted.</p>

<h2>Topics and ideas approached from a Christian perspective</h2>
<p>SpeakUP! is one of many activities and events coordinated by FOKUS.</p>
<p>Fokus is a Serbian nongovernmental organization that is committed to assisting the development of society through promoting Christian morals and values.  Because SpeakUp! is a conversational English camp, we will be conversing about topics and ideas.  Because SpeakUp! is coordinated by Fokus, those topics and ideas will be approached from a distinctively Christian perspective.  Conversations concerning these thoughts and ideas will be held with respect and appreciation for individual opinions and feelings.</p>
<p>In order to get some idea of what the camp topics and conversations will be like, you may want to take a look at an issue of VOX Magazine or check out the website at www.vox-magazin.com.  VOX Magazine is also produced by Fokus and approaches issues from a Christian perspective.</p>

<h2>Conversational American English</h2>
<p>SpeakUp! is a conversational American English camp.
<p>All of the tutors will be Americans and will speak American English.  British English will not be taught.  None of the tutors or organizers of SpeakUp! will be native British English speakers.</p>
<p>We will not teach basic grammar, vocabulary, or sentence structure.  We will simply immerse you in a relational and conversational environment in which American English predominates.  You will improve your English usage by using the English you already know as you interact with native English speakers.  Applicants must speak an intermediate level of English in order to come.  If you do not speak English at an intermediate level you will not understand nor will you be able to participate in the many interactive aspects of SpeakUp!.</p>

<h2>Drug and Alcohol usage</h2>
<p>Recreational drugs and alcohol are not welcome at SpeakUp!</p>
<p>We desire to establish a certain environment at our camp location and during our camp activities.  That environment is one of conversation, respect, relational interaction and self-control.  SpeakUp! will foster an environment in which people can communicate, have lots of fun, and express their opinions and ideas freely.  Recreational drugs and alcohol can impair judgment and endanger the environment we are working to establish.  Therefore, no alcohol or drugs (which are not for legitimate treatment of medical conditions) are allowed at camp activities or at the camp facilities.</p>
<p>On your application you will be asked if you understand and agree to abide by all the above expectations.</p>
<p>If you are accepted and will not abide by these expectations or if you endanger the experience of other participants in any way, you may be asked to leave SpeakUp!.</p>
<p>If you are asked to leave, you will be refunded the unused portion of your camp fee but you will be responsible for your return transportation costs.</p>
<p>For any questions concerning these expectations please contact Fokus.</p>
